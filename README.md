# Fresh Tomatoes

This is a python project I created for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.  It is a dynamically generated website that displays a list of my favourite movies.

This utilizes the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to get movie information based on a supplied movie title.  This allows me to write less code and expend less effort copying and pasting all the fields for my list of movies.  Unfortunately as of today the API doesn't include a link to a trailer so that must be provided seperately for each film.

I also wrote some custom CSS to style the page a little differently.  Enjoy!  Maybe you will find your new favourite movie in this list!
